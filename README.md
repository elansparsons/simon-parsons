# Simon's personal user manual

# What is this document?
A way to get to know me, for both friends and teammates.

# The basics
Central Florida -> Pittsburgh, PA -> Philadelphia, PA. Graduated from the University of Florida twice (B.S. Ecology, M.A. Latin American Studies). Now a data engineering type, but used to be a field botanist/ecologist. Pronouns they/them. Sometimes I'm known as the data dragon. üêâ

# My core tenets
**We should do our best to treat everyone well.** This of course takes into account each person's definition of what treating them 'well' is -- be considerate, be thoughtful, be sensitive.

**Don't forget to be a human.** Not everything is work and boundaries are good. Be focused when you need to, get things done on time and well, but ultimately take care of *you*. Rest is important.

# I‚Äôm at my best
- Before 3PM, with tea
- Working solo most of the time
- In decluttered but not spotless physical and virtual spaces: Inbox 5 (rather than 0) is what I strive for
- When meetings are collected rather than spread out throughout a day

# I can‚Äôt stand
**Being asked to come up with solutions on the spot.** My brain doesn't work like this. I will panic from wanting to come up with the 'perfect' idea fast, and answers won't be had. 'Brainstorming' sessions are the worst.

**Not having context.** If I'm asked about something important but don't know where it's coming from or why, I can't figure out what to give you, or whether it's appropriate.

# How I work best with others
Communication: Contact on Flowdock is best for quick information/requests; I won't be offended if you just ask something without a greeting. If it's more involved and/or urgent, short Zoom meetings are fine. I always have an email tab up. Can get overwhelmed, so be sure to include a rough deadline of your needs so I can gauge priority.

I need time to consider what's a good idea or to just mull things over, and this will mean I'm usually quiet in meetings larger than 1-on-1s. I am engaged, but thoughtful and want to test things out first. I'll still speak up for clarification for my work or things that will affect my work.

I try to be considerate in letting people know when something will be finished/delivered, and keeping them updated if plans change (as they often do). It will be done! Just maybe not when initially thought.

If something's not right, would rather know right away, but I'm working on not immediately jumping on every little thing that needs to be done.

I try to get everyone to a basic understanding of what we're doing and why, and will add context to a conversation if I think it's missing for someone.

Always happy to talk through it if something is confusing!

Please remind me about tasks you've asked of me if you don't hear anything after a few days. I may have forgotten.

# Known bugs with Simon
My pandemic brain is more scattered and it‚Äôs made auditory processing harder. I may ask you to repeat things, or send them to me in a message because I‚Äôm visual-oriented.

Energy levels can fluctuate a lot day-to-day.

# How you can help Simon
Tell me things! I like knowing what's going on and tend to keep an eye on what's happening with people, in society, etc. I want to listen, and help if I can.

Always allow the option to not have video on/not show up to social events. I'm a solid introvert, so I have to really consider where I use my energy -- can't always spend it worrying about what my hair is doing in social situations.

# Other useful or fun info about me
- I'm learning Mandarin Chinese for important tea reasons, so C-dramas and pop music from China and Taiwan are my jam right now. 
- I love Pride & Prejudice, I‚Äôm a watcher of many Twitch streams, I've been vegan for 10 years, I get fiery about injustice.
- I dig listening to podcasts about social issues (and surprising history, like with You‚Äôre Wrong About) while walking the dog.
- I have a million and one skills: juggling, knitting, painting, martial arts, etc. Few of them are useful.
